Fixed the following problems in config_parser.cc:

1. Codes after a slash inside the single quote is not correctly parsed (/' should be ' instead of / and ')
    like 'asdf/'' -> asdf'. 

2. No matching braces still get passed.

3. When the end of file if there is still unfinished token, the program shouldn't be successfully parsed.

4. Codes after a slash inside the double quote is not correctly parsed (/" should be " instead of / and ")
    like "asdf/"" -> asdf".
